This list is created to help you study for exam 1.

*Disclaimer:* The topics listed here may not be fully comprehensive. You should refer to
the notes posted on GitHub, as they form the main source material.

Topic 1: Data Science
* What is Data Science?
* What do data scientists do with data on a regular basis? 
* Explain and compare supervised/unsupervised learning.
* What is Git and GitHub? Why do data scientists use it?
* Where do data come from?
* Compare parameter/statistic.
* Be able to find unit of observation given a data set.
* What are variable types?
* Identify if a variable is categorical (nominal/ordinal) or numeric (discrete/cont)
* What is a data matrix? What is a data frame?
* What are the mean measures of center? Explain how each is calculated and why some are more appropriate than others in certain settings.
* What is skewness? Identify the direction of skewness given a distribution.

Topic 2: R

Be able to,
* Create a scalar, vector, list, dataframe object.
* Declare a factor variable with custom levels.
* Access an element of an object using position and/or header name.

Topic 3: Visualization
* What is bar graph, pie chart, stem/leaf plot, dotplot, histogram, scatterplot? Identify for what variable type(s) each can be used.
* Find the rule of thumb number of bars for a histogram. Implement it in R.
Be able to,
* Create the graphs above using base R.
* Create a bar graph, box plot, histogram, scatterplot using ggplot2.
* Use conditional coloring in base R and ggplot2.
